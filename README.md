## UX

### User stories

As a potential gym customer I expect to see the classes of The Premier Gym.

And also I expect to see the class timetable.

### Strategy
My aim for the website design was in the easiest way possible to access information while trying to make a website for user-friendly page.

### Scope
For gym users, I wanted to provide them some information about gym classes, class timetables and show some images.

### Structure
In the Classes section, I try to explain that which classes can be found at the gym and there is also short brief of each class they can join. And also they can find the class timetable showing the time and days for each class.

### Surface

The dark grey color was used to design the page.

### Technology

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.2.1)


### Features
This website was designed for one page only. You can find four sections that classes, gallery, timetable and contact. The site was build mobile friendly using Bootstrap features.

### Features Left to Implement
Some new classes and its timetables will be added in future.


### Testing
When you look at this website can find some information about the classes and its timetables and also links to our social media pages.

If you want to send a message to us, you need to fill the form on Contact section. If you do not fill the form, you will be notified because the "required" attribute was added to each fields of the form.

All social media links open in a new window using '"target="_blank"' and all of them have been tested to make sure that they open in a new tab and correct destination.

This website was tested on different browsers and mobile devices to make sure everything is working correctly. On mobile devices, the page was looking responsive and all sections was shown in the middle.

During testing, I have added a class to the top nav bar using "fixed-top" Bootstrap class to fixed the navbar on the top of the page.


### Deployment
This website is hosted using Github pages, deployed directly from the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on Github pages, the landing page needs to be named 'index.html'.
To run locally, you can clone this repository.
